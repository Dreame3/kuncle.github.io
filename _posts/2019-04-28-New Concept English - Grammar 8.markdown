* 反意疑问句
  + 结构：  
    + 前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开   
    + 陈述句肯定则问句否定，陈述句否定则问句肯定。
  + 注意：
    1. 问句主语需要和主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词
    2. 前后助动词，时态须保持一致
    3. 没有助动词的，后面部分需要加上助动词（只能加do, does, did）
    > eg:  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You **have lived** here for many years, **haven't** you? 前肯后否，助动词为have，前后需保持一致  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won't be late, will he?  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are tired, aren't you?  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't going to rain tomorrow, is it?  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out, didn't he?前面部分没有助动词，需要我们去添加助动词do，does，did  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You love me, don't you?  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't feel ill, does he?  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can wait for me, can't you?  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no water here, is there?

* 直接引语与间接引语（引用别人的话）
  + 直接引语与间接引语都是宾语
  + 直接引语即一字不差引用别人的话，需放在单引号内
  + 间接引语则是用自己的话转述别人的话，不需要引号，而以宾语从句的形式出现。
  + 直接引语变间接引语时须注意人称和时态的变化：
    + 人称的变化：按照中文作相应改变
    + 时态的变化：
      1. 若当即转述别人的话，动词（如say，tell等）用一般现在时，则直接引语中的时态不用作任何改变放在间接引语中。
      > eg:  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says:'I am busy.' -> He says that he is busy.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.Jones says:'I have just finished my work.' -> Mr.Jones says that he has just finished his work.    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally says:'I'm sitting under the tree.' -> Sally says that she is sitting under the tree.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara says:'I broke that plate.' -> Sara says that she broke that plate.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack says:'I'll go to England tomorrow.' -> Jack says that he will go to England tomorrow.  
      2. 若过来一段时间再转述别人的话，动词用一般过去时态（said，told等），则时态需作如下变化：
      直接引语      间接引语  
      一般现在时 -> 一般过去时  
      一般过去时 -> 过去完成时  
      现在进行时 -> 过去进行时  
      一般将来时 -> 过去将来时  
      现在完成时 -> 过去完成时  
      情态动词 -> 对应的过去式  
      > eg:  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said:'I'm hungry.' -> She said that she was hungry.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am having breakfast,' he told me. -> He told me that he was having breakfast.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said:'I want to see you.' -> He said that he wanted to see me.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said:'I've just made a new film.' -> She said that she had just made a new film.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said:'I am going to retire.' -> She said that she was going to retire.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom said:'I broke the cup.' -> Tom said that he had broken the cup.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane said to Jack:'I love you.' -> Jane said to Jack that she loved him.  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said:'We will come back soon.' -> He said that they would come back soon.
